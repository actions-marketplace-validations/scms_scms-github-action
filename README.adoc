= scms-github-action

Checks a repository for scms compatibility

== Inputs

=== `parallelity`

Set parallelity.
The default is `"1"` which is single threaded.
Note that parallelity will fail-at-end and result in unordered log outputs.

Note: this parameter loosely follows the maven syntax. Use `1C` for one thread per core,
use `12` for exactly 12 threads and `0.9C` for rounded 0.9 threads per core.

=== `verbose`

Sets the verbosity.
The default is `INFO` for scms classes and `WARN` for 3rd-party libraries.
Use `true` for verbose output (`DEBUG` for all messages).

=== `inputpath`

Set the input path relative to the repository.
Please note that absolute paths and paths containing `/..` or `../` will be rejected.


== Outputs
